# Grocer #

## Description ##
Grocer is your personal grocery list assistant. It will automatically build a meal plan and grocery list for you based on your recipe library.

You can use Grocer's default recipe library as a template to add your own custom recipes.

## Development ##
Currently no third party libraries are required for the main project. Within the **Utilities** directory, you will find a Pip **requirements.txt** file as the recipe scrapers require a few 3rd party libraries in order to run.
